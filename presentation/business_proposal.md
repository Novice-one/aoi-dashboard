# AI-Driven AOI Dashboard for Solar Cell Excellence
## Optimizing Quality & Yield in Production Lines

---

### The Business Challenge
- manual inspection is slow and error-prone.
- lack of real-time visibility into machine performance.
- difficult to identify root causes of frequent defects.
- **Goal**: Minimize NG (No-Good) counts and maximize First Pass Yield (FPY).

---

### Introducing the AI Dashboard
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live tracking of defects across all machines.
- **Deep Analytics**: Identify trends, shifts, and specific machine failures.
- **Zero-Cost Demo**: Accessible via anywhere (hosted on GitHub Pages).

---

### Defect Analysis: Identifying Patterns
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Instantly see where defects are most frequent on the wafer.
- **Top Defects**: Pareto analysis shows that 80% of issues often come from 20% of defect types.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Focus engineering efforts on the most impactful issues.

### Machine Performance Tracking
- **Which machine is producing more defects?**
- Compare Front-side vs. Rear-side production efficiency.
- Monitor Yield (FPY) and DPPM (Defects Per Million) per machine.

### Strategic Impact & ROI
- **Reduced Waste**: Early detection prevents processing of defective wafers.
- **Improved Throughput**: Faster identification of machine bottlenecks.
- **Quality Assurance**: 100% inspection coverage with consistent AI standards.
- **Competitive Edge**: Showcase modern, data-driven manufacturing to customers.
